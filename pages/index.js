        <p>Hello, my name is Sean Kurtley J. Girado. I am 20 years old and I live in San Mateo Arayat, Pampanga. 
          For fun, I like to play basketball, cook different foods, and go swimming. My favorite song is "Jesus is Lord," and my favorite food is Bicol Express because I love its rich, spicy taste. 
          Looking ahead, I have big plans for the next five years. I want to become a top software engineer. I plan to work on important projects, get better at new technologies, and help teach other new developers. 
          My goal is to grow my skills so I can be a leader in the tech world.</p>
